#Do not change tags in here without changing every other reference to them.
#If adding new forms of governemnts, make sure they are uniquely named.

#Uses all 'modifiers' possible that's exported as a Modifier.

# valid_for_new_country determines which governments can be converted to normally
# allow_convert determines which governments can be force-converted to and from via CBs

# ai_will_do determines what government the AI picks. If same, it will prefer current government, and secondly those that are higher up in the file
# ai_importance determines what government is automatically picked when reforming, creating new country, etc.
# Hardcoded: AI will never choose to change between republic and monarchy, or from a government for that allows royal marriages to one that doesn't
